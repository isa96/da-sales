> Helping companies understand their data

## Background Information
Wondermarket is a German retail supermarket which has opened up 50 stores across the UK within the last 10 years. 
They are seeing a huge amount of growth, but as they are growing they are also spotting a lot of inefficiencies.

They have provided us with some datasets and it is my job as a data analyst to prepare, analyse, visualise and extract insights from the data, 
relevant to their expectations. The client’s expectations from this task are:

* They want to know which stores are performing best and which ones are performing worst
* They want to understand the regions with the largest opportunity for growth if they were to open a new store
* They want to understand what top 5 products they should sell in a new store to maximise profit when they first open

A large part of a data analyst’s job is to translate technical insights and concepts into relatable and understandable terms and outcomes for the client. 
Therefore, having a deep understanding of the data, the client’s business and their processes is important to complete this task.

## Task Brief
### 1. Business understanding
* Read through the company background document to understand Wondermarket, their business challenges, and processes.

### 2. Exploratory data analysis
* Explore the provided dataset to understand its relation to the business, statistical properties, and formulate ways to address client expectations.

### 3. Problem solving
* Utilize the understanding of the business and data to extract insights and address each of the client's expectations.
* Perform necessary aggregations and calculations on the datasets to derive meaningful conclusions.

### 4. Presentation of results
* Present the insights to the client in a clear, concise, and relatable format, such as an executive summary slide.
* Seek additional resources for guidance on creating effective presentations.
