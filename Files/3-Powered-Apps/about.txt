Enhancing businesses’ existing processes with technology and innovation.

# Background Information
Utopia is a global online banking company that specialises in technology solutions within the fintech industry. They are based in the UK but have a global presence, with over 10,000 employees. 

Utopia has been scaling at an extremely fast rate. Just 5 years ago there were 4 employees, the original co-founders, now there are over 10,000. Utopia is still a startup at heart, with a real focus on working dynamically, fostering innovation and making sure their employees are working on exciting topics. 

However, by reaching such a large scale so quickly, they have skipped some really important process changes that are vital for a large organisation. In particular, HR has not been a big focus for Utopia as they have been growing, so they have contacted KPMG to help transform their global HR practice and to help them build a global HR system.

In particular, they have identified 3 problems within HR that they want help with:

	Attracting and retaining the best talent in the workplace
	Accurately managing headcount
	Gathering feedback regularly from employees to have a better sense of workplace satisfaction and work-life balance

It is your job to gain an understanding of Utopia’s current HR landscape and to formulate some exciting ideas on how they can address the three problem areas with new technologies.

# Task Brief
1. Market understanding

After this, you should read through the industry reports provided. These will give you an understanding of the latest trends within HR. Feel free to also do your own research online to gain a wider understanding of HR trends. Use your understanding of Utopia to start thinking about how the latest trends within HR can be applied to their business. This should take you 25-30 minutes.

2. Create presentation for the Client

Now you must create a PowerPoint presentation containing your recommendations for how they should transform their processes and technology, with regards to their HR issues. This presentation should be clear, concise, use relatable business terminology for the client and should demonstrate that KPMG has a clear vision on how to transform their global HR business function. This should take you 20-30 minutes. Make use of the Future of Work PDF that is provided to give you some insights into some HR trends. However, also make use of your own research if the insights from this PDF do not give you some ideas to answer the three challenges of Utopia.
